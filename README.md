# DogBreedProject

This project is about the Recognition of the type of the Dog Breed using Convolutional Neural Network in Keras.

This project is implemented using VGG19 Transfer Learning which gave the highest accuracy for predicitng the dog breed image 
when the dog image or human image is given that also classifies whether the image contains human or dog by detecting the face 
using OpenCV

We also compare different transfer learning such as VGG16, Resnet and a simple Multi Layer Convulutional Network which compares 
accuracy between these algorithms.
